# Dice Game

## Problem Formulation

You and your friend are playing a dice game. Each one picks a (unique) number from 1 to 6. You take turns to roll the dice until one person rolls their own number (if you roll your friends number, or viceversa, nobody wins). Estimate the probability of winning if you start first and if you start second.
